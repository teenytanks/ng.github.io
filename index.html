            TeenyTanks is a 2 player board game that revolves around moving units on a 8x16 board and winning by eliminating all enemy units. 
            You'll need a dice, some kind of game board, and some small objects to act as units to play.
            This page will give some basic rules that are meant to be occasionally ambiguous. Disputes should be solved by replaying turns, flipping coins, or other methods that both players agree on.

            One player starts on the red squares, and the other starts on the blue squares. 
            Before the game starts, each player must place 7 terrain pieces onto their side of the board (left half and right half).
            Terrain pieces cannot be placed in a spawn zone, here's an example layout.
        </p>

            Now the players each draft 4 units. Units are selected from the 6 existing classes, and a player cannot draft more than 2 units from one class.
            Units are placed in the respective spawn zones (no stacking units) and players flip a coin to decide who moves first.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/units.png" width="600" height="300">
        <p>
            Above is an example draft. During a player's turn, they select one controlled unit to make a move with. Said unit can either attack then move, or move then attack.
            The selected unit does not need to move and/or attack, but movement and attack cannot be split amongst 2 units in one turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stalemates: To avoid stalemates and speed up pace of play, on the 5th turn after damage has not been dealt to any units, and a unit has been destroyed, the leftmost and rightmost columns are removed. This continues every turn regardless of tank damage until the game ends.
            If all remaining units are destroyed simultaneously on the same turn, the game ends in a stalemate.
        </p>
        <h5 style="font-size:x-large">This ruleset is extremely basic, but it's what I've found to work well from a couple hours of play. Feel free to change up the rules, add modes, or your own units.</h5>
